[Supspot](https://supspot.ch) is the fist dedicated software to rent Stand up Paddles and manage renting spots. It is an enterprise-distributed app that can be installed on stand-up paddles rental machines.

This is an iPad-only app built on React Native that connects to the pad lock, the credit card payment system and the ticket printer via Bluetooth to enable the user to rent stand-up paddles 24/7. SupSpot is a small but dedicated startup with a very focused team that contacted APSL to bring their idea to life. I was responsible of helping them define the product, develop the app and manage the mobile team.
