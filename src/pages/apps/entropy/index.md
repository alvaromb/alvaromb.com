Entropy Dispatcher is a part of [WDNA](https://wdna.com/solutions)'s solutions for network management. It is intented to provide assistance and work orders to field operators working for mobile networking companies that install and manage mobile networks.

The app is entirely build on React Native, implementing a custom JSON-based form rendering and dynamic workflow that enables field operators to manage their job orders efficiently. We built for iOS and Android using the same React Native codebase.

The app is a part of WDNA's private tools and it's not available for download.
