Nauticheck is the mobile app for the boat management system [Nauticadvisor](https://www.nauticadvisor.com/en/nauticheck/). It was the first full app built for iOS and Android from scratch, sharing the same codebase and similar design clues.

Later on, the Mobile Team at APSL has succeeded updating the app and supporting the latest React Native versions. You can download the app for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nauticheck/id1046893573) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nauticadvisor.nauticheck).
