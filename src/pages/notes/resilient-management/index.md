# Chapters

## Introduction

- Stages of group development.
  - Forming: new group comes together.
  - Storming: starting friction.
  - Norming: individuals begin to resolve differences.
  - Performing: effective, flow state.
- Groups (or group changes) can restart this process.
- Skills: human growth and resiliency skills.

## Meet your team

- Foster trust: understand each other, person needs, preferences and approaches.
- Learn about teammates differences.
- Humans core needs: BICEPS
  - Belonging.
  - Improvement.
  - Choice.
  - Equality (information, resources).
  - Predictability (balance in changes).
  - Significance.
- Share BICEPS with teammates to see how they fit.
- First 1:1 questions are great to start knowing BICEPS of your reports.
- Grumpiness questions are very relevant:
  - _What makes you grumpy?_
  - _How will I know you're grumpy?_
  - _How can I help you when you're grumpy?_
- They will help to know best times for 1:1's, autonomy and how the team tackle the work.
- Feedback and recognition are good key questions for initial 1:1.
- Get to know early how reports prefer to receive recognition, when and if public or private.
- Goals and support are related to how to get things done.
- Goals for 1yr, 9m, 6m, 3m.
- What does the report need from management, peers and teammates?
- **Why and what is the most valuable thing in 1:1 for report?** Ask and discover this.
- Wordy growth question for long term growing (discover how the report wants to grow).
- How the ICs treat themselves? It is the most important question for initial 1:1 because you might need it along the way.
- All these questions can give you a great picture of your team.
- It's also important to let the team know you. Name behavior and improve together.
- What are you optimizing for? I do for vision, mentoring and feedback delivery.
- Tip: optimize for long-term relationships. Align 1:1 work with current role and future roles in career perspective.
- Share a summary of MadLib with reports in initials 1:1 (my answers as a manager):
  - What do you optimize for?
  - What do you hope teammates will lean on you for?
  - What management skill are you working on learning or improving?

## Grow your teammates

- Managers should help grow and support the team progress.
- For different hats:
  - **Mentoring**: help the other person overcome a roadblock. Problem + solution. What would I've done.
  - **Coaching**: asking open questions, reflecting. "What" questions. Repeat back. Choose when helping somebody.
  - **Sponsoring**: helping others reach next level. Take advantage of the many moments to do it.
  - **Delivering feedback**: combines mentoring, coaching, sponsoring. Sometimes it exists as a formal process in the company. You need to deliver both positive and negative. Depends also on organizational structure.

> The best feedback is specific, actionable and delivered in a way that ensures the receiver can actually absorb it.

- Use some framework as SBI (situation, behavior, impact).
- Write down SBI before conducting feedback session.
- Impact can be frame in terms of something that the person cares about.
- It's better to avoid making the person feel threatened.
- It is critical for your team to also know how to give proper feedback. Use sponsoring, coaching and mentoring!
- To deliver third party feedback, you need to search for something you can own too.
- **1:1 objectives**:
  - Build trust.
  - Gain shared context.
  - Plan out and support career growth.
  - Solve problems.
- Feedback could not work. Moving to other team could. Beware not to pass a problem.
- Set clear expectations about how to ship, how to hit goals and how to level up.

## Set clear expectations

- Need to define shared expectations to reach organization goals.
- Document team-wide expectations. Do it with the team.
  - Roles, vision, responsibilities, how to collaborate, communicate.
- **Roles & responsibilities**:
  - Humans benefit from clarity in day to day operations.
  - Two tools: responsibility assignment matrix and Venn diagrams.
  - Important also: ladder, skills matrix, job descriptions.
  - **RACI matrix** (responsible, accountable, consulted, informed). Per project or task.
  - **Venn diagram**: use it to define responsibilities in cross functional teams. Iterate, share and modify. Should evolve during time. Can be used in many different roles.
- **Vision**:
  - **VMSO statement** is the North Star of every company. Vision, Mission, Strategy, Objectives.
- Onboarding live doc is important as team practice.
  - Put regular meetings, syncs, VMSO, project status, etc.
