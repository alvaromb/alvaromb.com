## Scaling hiring: Close, onboard & beyond

- Steps:
  - Offer.
  - Onboarding.
  - Off-boarding.
- Better to have a single person (hiring manager) directing the candidate through all the process.
- Create meaning when communicating the offer (**always be closing**).
- Acqui-hires can be complex. You need to interview all employees, disband teams and set clear expectations.
- Be aware of the acqui-hires antipatterns.
- Check data & evaluate the hiring process: attrition, turnover, time between contact and offer, source, success in every stage, etc.
- Onboarding: key to have good retention.
- Onboarding evolution:
  - Improvised (initial stages): create a guide, document the process, assign a mentor.
  - Team rotation (+20 employees stage): perform easy tasks in each team plus improvised.
  - Program (bigger Co.): specific to area, bootcamp like. Beware of schedule, impact and apply all the above.
- Buddy: can be combined with the other approaches.
- Off-boarding means exit interviews for discovering root causes.
- 3 main causes of attrition:
  - Culture change.
  - Lack of career advancement.
  - Lack of attention to organization.
