## 1. Scaling hiring: Growing the team

- A well-designed hiring process yields great results for the company.
- Hire to cover gaps, not for _warm bodies_.
- Better not to hire than hire poorly.
- Diversity is key when the team has its foundations.
- Treat well all the candidates.
- Establish roles & relationships with recruiters and the recruiting coordinator.
- Referrals, applies and sourcing (search for candidates actively) are the main sources of candidates.
- Align hiring manager and hiring coordinator.
- Culture and employer brand can help hires.

### Open questions

1. How to reach the perfect balance for strict and easy hiring process?
2. How to know when we need to hire and when is not necessary? Re. _warm bodies_.

## 2. Scaling hiring: Interviews & hiring decisions

- Screening process can filter candidates.
- **4 steps/interviews per hiring is enough for the process accuracy.**
  - Screening CV.
  - Screening call.
  - Challenge.
  - Interview.
- Search for facts and achievements in CV analysis.
- Orient technical challenge to what is needed in the company.
- Search for candidates that prepared and learned about the company.

> Install a process that ensures good decisions are made.

- Models:
  - Hiring manager.
  - High-ranking hiring manager (like VP Engineering doing all the hires).
  - Consensus.
  - Hiring committee.
  - Bar raisers.
- Balance diversity addressing bias.
- Beware of the interview panel. Choose wisely how and who participates.

## 3. Scaling hiring: Close, onboard & beyond

- Steps:
  - Offer.
  - Onboarding.
  - Off-boarding.
- Better to have a single person (hiring manager) directing the candidate through all the process.
- Create meaning when communicating the offer (**always be closing**).
- Acqui-hires can be complex. You need to interview all employees, disband teams and set clear expectations.
- Be aware of the acqui-hires antipatterns.
- Check data & evaluate the hiring process: attrition, turnover, time between contact and offer, source, success in every stage, etc.
- Onboarding: key to have good retention.
- Onboarding evolution:
  - Improvised (initial stages): create a guide, document the process, assign a mentor.
  - Team rotation (+20 employees stage): perform easy tasks in each team plus improvised.
  - Program (bigger Co.): specific to area, bootcamp like. Beware of schedule, impact and apply all the above.
- Buddy: can be combined with the other approaches.
- Off-boarding means exit interviews for discovering root causes.
- 3 main causes of attrition:
  - Culture change.
  - Lack of career advancement.
  - Lack of attention to organization.

## 4. People management: Getting started

> Explicit focus on people management is vital to success, especially at fast growing companies.

- Morale, alignment, goals.
- Help to efficiently pursue a goal.
- Top goals for EM:
  - Right people on, wrong people off.
  - Happiness, productivity through motivation, career, compensation and learning.
  - Focus on high priority, resolve disputes, decision-making and remove distractions.
  - Providing all necessary resources.

### From _ad-hoc_ to formal management

- Search for burnout signs to act. Otherwise, face **management debt**.
- Peter Drucker's _span of control_ means between 7 to 10 ICs for each manager.
- Teams that need to grow quickly will get most benefit from dedicated people manager.
- Prepare your team before introducing formal management.
- Technical prowess `!==` management potential.
- Communicate and rollout management structure.
- Beware! **this is not a promotion** and shouldn't be seen as one.
- Important to introduce bottom-up mechanisms to influence in the roadmap:
  - Occasional skip-levels.
  - Roundtable discussions.

### How to evaluate potential managers

- Management potential framework:
  - Up: alerting, giving up feedback, etc.
  - Sideways: collaborating with peers.
  - Down: leading ICs instinctively, teaching and mentoring.
- Traits: organic leadership, empathy, communication, mentorship, strategic thinking.
- Negative traits: stress management, conflict avoidance, control, information hoarding.

> Management reward cycle is way longer than IC.

- Foster ongoing management education & set-up some structured learning tips like reading groups, shadowing or mentorship training.
- Again, management role `!==` promotion.

### Interviewing managers

- Steps:
  - Pre-screening.
  - Check references.
  - Prepare IC to interview managers.
  - On-board like IC to help know the tech stack.

## 5. People management at scale

- Management at scale comes with different problems.
- Improve managers with:
  - Providing a mentor.
  - Establish a learning program (book club also works).
  - Assign someone for management quality.
- Tribal identities can occur. **Invest in manager to manager relationship**.
- Look for opportunities for manager collaboration. EM forum collaboration for instance.
- Measuring manager performance is really important.
  - Define expectations.
  - Gather data about the team to measure performance.
  - Skip-level and other meetings to gather frequent feedback.
  - Competition isn't feedback.
  - Seek for performance, not likeability.
- Underperformance
  - Handle with care, planning and adjusting when letting go a manager.

### Morale under rapid growth

- Prepare the team to face growth. Explain opportunities and tackle skepticism and potential issues (loss of autonomy, fewer opportunities with newer hires, etc.).

  > With growth can come a sense of having less impact and ownership.
  >
  > - Build empowerment from the bottom.
  > - Focus failures on learning, not punishment.
  > - Avoid formal processes that stop innovation.
  > - Reward getting things done.
  > - Let ICs work on what's interesting for them.
  > - "Team shopping" can be positive.

### Work-life balance

- Realistic, not arbitrary deadlines.
- Leaders should be good examples.
- Heroes are unhealthy for the teams.

### Diversity

- Participating in diversity hiring or activities can be a burden for underrepresented people.
- Beware of environment and _null process_ (absence of formal process).
- Promote work-life balance and use metrics to surface bias.

### Continuous learning

- Ongoing education is key for good engagement and performance.
- Learning budget, conferences, meetups, etc.
- Mentoring is very effective for young leaders.
- Retrospectives, post-mortems and cross training are good strategies for team learning.

### Career development

- Career path is critical when introducing formal management.
- Consider separate tracks for IC/Management.
- Levels can be tricky when they're introduced. Slotting and promotion.
- A promotion process is key for growth.

## 6. Scaling the organization: design principles

> _The purpose of organization is to reduce the amount of communication and coordination necessary_
> -- Mythical Man-Month

- Avoid diseconomies of scale (hiring reduces output).
- Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation:
  - Autonomy
  - Mastery
  - Purpose
- Organizing by skill-set is common in early stage.
- **Value Streams** are affected after growing.
- Goals while growing: move fast and connect employees to the product.
- Principles:
  - Agile mindset.
  - Delivery teams (also, _domains_).
  - Autonomy.
  - Purpose and measure success.
  - Continuous value delivery.
  - Continuous learning culture.

### Delivery teams

- Can deliver 95% of backlog independently.
- Cross knowledge, has all the necessary skill-set inside the team.
- Embrace autonomy: motivation comes when they clearly understand the effect on customers. They have a good picture on whatever needs to be done.
- Measure success & establish purpose: KPI team goals are fundamental. Go from company KPI to team KPI.

## 7. Scaling the organization: delivery teams

- Can be build around: platform, features, company or customer.
  - **Platform**: it's the easiest and works great on small companies. Does not scale well.
  - **Features**: scales very well. Can be difficult to handle growing amount of features without growing the team.
  - **Company goals**: keeps clear how to contribute. Can be difficult to scale.
  - **Customer**: develop for customer groups without dependencies. Clear alignment with customer needs. Hard to scale.

### Value stream mapping

- Can help improve existing suboptimal setups.
- Good example of VSM from Phil Cal√ßado p. 147.
- From one team to two:
  - Beware of shared members when splitting teams (bus factor).
  - Sync between teams are good ways to avoid siloing.
  - How to improve: measure average cycle time.
  - **Use VSM in retrospectives**.
  - Search for heavy coordination time in retros.
  - Check VSM: [bit.ly/2gVZ8xd](bit.ly/2gVZ8xd)

## 8. Scaling the organization: reporting structure

- Question: which engineers should report to which managers?
- Question: how many reports per manager? Drucker's _span of management responsibilities_, between 7 to 10.
- 4 ways to organize:
  - One EM per delivery team.
  - One EM per entire delivery team (including design & PM).
  - One EM per specialization (tech).
  - General people management.
- Combining multiple approaches is what makes sense.
- Next level: additional level of management (Director of Engineering).
- Infra/platform teams are needed to treat inside team as user/customer.
- Transition phase: combination stage is normal when adding platforms (Android, iOS, mobile, etc.). Can integrate later.
