1. How to reach the perfect balance for strict and easy hiring process?
2. How to know when we need to hire and when is not necessary? Re. _warm bodies_.

## Scaling hiring: Interviews & hiring decisions

- Screening process can filter candidates.
- **4 steps/interviews per hiring is enough for the process accuracy.**
  - Screening CV.
  - Screening call.
  - Challenge.
  - Interview.
- Search for facts and achievements in CV analysis.
- Orient technical challenge to what is needed in the company.
- Search for candidates that prepared and learned about the company.

> Install a process that ensures good decisions are made.

- Models:
  - Hiring manager.
  - High-ranking hiring manager (like VP Engineering doing all the hires).
  - Consensus.
  - Hiring committee.
  - Bar raisers.
- Balance diversity addressing bias.
- Beware of the interview panel. Choose wisely how and who participates.

## Scaling hiring: Close, onboard & beyond

- Steps:
  - Offer.
  - Onboarding.
  - Off-boarding.
- Better to have a single person (hiring manager) directing the candidate through all the process.
- Create meaning when communicating the offer (**always be closing**).
- Acqui-hires can be complex. You need to interview all employees, disband teams and set clear expectations.
- Be aware of the acqui-hires antipatterns.
- Check data & evaluate the hiring process: attrition, turnover, time between contact and offer, source, success in every stage, etc.
- Onboarding: key to have good retention.
- Onboarding evolution:
  - Improvised (initial stages): create a guide, document the process, assign a mentor.
  - Team rotation (+20 employees stage): perform easy tasks in each team plus improvised.
  - Program (bigger Co.): specific to area, bootcamp like. Beware of schedule, impact and apply all the above.
- Buddy: can be combined with the other approaches.
- Off-boarding means exit interviews for discovering root causes.
- 3 main causes of attrition:
  - Culture change.
  - Lack of career advancement.
  - Lack of attention to organization.

## People management: Getting started

> Explicit focus on people management is vital to success, especially at fast growing companies.

- Morale, alignment, goals.
- Help to efficiently pursue a goal.
- Top goals for EM:
  - Right people on, wrong people off.
  - Happiness, productivity through motivation, career, compensation and learning.
  - Focus on high priority, resolve disputes, decision-making and remove distractions.
  - Providing all necessary resources.

### From _ad-hoc_ to formal management

- Search for burnout signs to act. Otherwise, face **management debt**.
- Peter Drucker's _span of control_ means between 7 to 10 ICs for each manager.
- Teams that need to grow quickly will get most benefit from dedicated people manager.
- Prepare your team before introducing formal management.
- Technical prowess `!==` management potential.
- Communicate and rollout management structure.
- Beware! **this is not a promotion** and shouldn't be seen as one.
- Important to introduce bottom-up mechanisms to influence in the roadmap:
  - Occasional skip-levels.
  - Roundtable discussions.

### How to evaluate potential managers

- Management potential framework:
  - Up: alerting, giving up feedback, etc.
  - Sideways: collaborating with peers.
  - Down: leading ICs instinctively, teaching and mentoring.
- Traits: organic leadership, empathy, communication, mentorship, strategic thinking.
- Negative traits: stress management, conflict avoidance, control, information hoarding.

> Management reward cycle is way longer than IC.

- Foster ongoing management education & set-up some structured learning tips like reading groups, shadowing or mentorship training.
- Again, management role `!==` promotion.

### Interviewing managers

- Steps:
  - Pre-screening.
  - Check references.
  - Prepare IC to interview managers.
  - On-board like IC to help know the tech stack.
