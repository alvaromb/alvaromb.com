<p class="lead">I wanted to do a year retrospective for a long time ago. These past two years have been pretty strange to say the least, so I won't be harsh with myself. I think it's useful to frequently reflect about what went well and what sucked, and what a better time to do that than the second week of January.</p>

It's already 2022 and it's been almost two years since this madness started. My earliest memories about the COVID-19 pandemic date back from late 2020 January in Barcelona, Spain. I was in the IESE campus, the first or the second day of the [PDD program](https://executiveeducation.iese.edu/es/directores-funcionales/pdd/). It is a high-tech well-equipped campus in a very exclusive neighborhood of Barcelona called Pedralbes. It's January 24, 2020 to be precise, and I just flew from Mallorca at 06:00am. We're having a coffee with other alumni in the rest area, which has TV screens with either Bloomberg or some other business channel[^1]. After the first classes, we go back to grab more coffee and there's a big, bold text in the news channel that says something like _"deadly pneumonia"_. PDD classes for those who are already working full time run each Friday, so we go home late by night and come back the next week. First week of February and we keep seeing similar headlines in all the TV's around the campus. But this time the thing already has a name: COVID-19.

So, fast-forward to 2022, I don't know what the hell happened. Yesterday I was enjoying a healthy (almost perfect) balance of family time, work time and simultaneously going to the PDD program and [the enabling MSc.](https://mfp.uib.cat) to have a computer science teacher alternative path, and right now I feel I aged 20 years in 20 months. What a better time to do a quick retro about the past year and start working to achieve, again, that perfect healthy balance, right? But, before that, let's start with 2021's highlights.

## Retro methodology

I'm a big fan of [Alexander Grosse](https://twitter.com/klangberater)'s [retrospective methodology at SoundCloud](https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/how-we-do-retrospectives)[^2]. It's simple enough to be both powerful and easy to use. Basically, there are **three** categories:

- Less.
- Same.
- More.

I will add, too, some quantification and objectives so I can know if I'm getting there or not. That's all we need to run a personal retro and get meaningful results, so let's dive in.

## Less

Basically, what should I do less? What should I reduce this 2022? Writing down this, daily, is actually a proven methodology to do therapy, so why not keeping a record of what I don't like to spend time doing? It might be hard to reduce to zero, but a 1% increase in the good direction compounds in the long term.

### Zero physical activity weeks

### News consumption

### Social media and FOMO

### Debt

### Family discussions

## Same

### Home cooking

### Early mornings

## More

### Return to cycling

### Read an hour, daily

### Family planning
