Rentals PMS is one of the few projects we have started entirely on APSL. It compromises a group of software dedicated to manage vacation rental properties. One of those pieces of software is [Rentals PMS Guest App](https://www.rentalspms.com). This is an app that it is intended to help the guests of the vacation homes to manage their booking while they're on destination.

A couple of the features of this app are:

- Offline maps for navigating to the property without network connection using Mapbox.
- Fully built on React Native with complex interactions.
- Offline information caching.

Also, this was the first project that I personally controlled all the lifecycle of the development: product, wireframing, design, development and team management.

You can download the app for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/guestapp-by-rentalspms/id1345528007?ls=1&mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guestapp&hl=en_US).
