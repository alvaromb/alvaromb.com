[2GN](https://www.2gn.es/) is a location-based social app that connects neighbors that need to sell or buy goods or services. It is intented to be used as a local help community.

We built the app entirely on React Native, making use of animations and complex user interactions. The app also used *websocket*s to implement the chat feature.

Download the app for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/2gn/id1133890369) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twogoodneighbors).
